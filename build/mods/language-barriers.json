Sims can either speak these languages natively (with traits), or study them as second languages (with skills). Their communication options with other sims is limited based on their knowledge of these languages, and they may accidentally insult, enrage, or confuse the sims they are speaking with.</p><p class=\"danger\"><strong class=\"danger\">Be advised</strong>: Some social interactions will be hidden for particular pairs of sims.

The traits are for native speakers (L1), and the skills are for second language learners (L2).</p><p>These traits are added automatically in the background or by using cheats (they are not in CAS). The skills can be acquired by studying on Simlingo (phone/computer/tablet), reading a textbook (bookshelf), or by talking to sims who know another language.</p><p>Native speakers are fluent in a language because they grew up speaking it, while second language learners have varying degrees of fluency depending on the level of their skill. Most sims will only have one native language, but children who grow up speaking multiple languages may be multilingual. These multilingual sims earn the <span class=\"whitespace-nowrap font-bold\"><img class=\"inline-block h-5\" data-src=\"multilingual\" alt=\"multilingual\"> Native Multilingual</span> trait, which helps them learn second languages faster than other sims.</p></div><br><div class=\"images-md\"><img data-src=\"textbook\"> <img data-src=\"simlingo\"> <img data-src=\"mortified\"></div><h2>Automatic language assignment</h2><div class=\"paragraphs\"><p>Language traits/skills are automatically added to sims (children and older) when they first spawn into the world while LB is installed.</p><br><h4>Native language traits</h4><p>A sim's default native language(s) are determined by their home world, their traits/occult type, and the language(s) their parents speak. If they have more than one native language, they gain the <span class=\"whitespace-nowrap font-bold\"><img class=\"inline-block h-5\" data-src=\"multilingual\" alt=\"multilingual\"> Native Multilingual</span> trait as well.</p><p class=\"footnote\">Sims are guaranteed to have at least one native language. Their native language(s) can only be changed through cheats.</p><br><h4>Second language skills</h4><p>A sim's default second language(s) are determined by their native language(s), home world, traits/occult type, and the language(s) their parents and romantic partner speak. How well they speak each language (i.e. the level of their skill, from 1 to 10) is determined by its genetic closeness to their native language(s), their traits, their age, and some other factors.</p><p class=\"footnote\">Sims are guaranteed to have at least one language in common with their parents and partner. If they don't share a native language, they will acquire the other's as a skill.</p></div><h2>Toddler language acquisition</h2><div class=\"paragraphs\"><p>Babies and toddlers do not have native languages - they are acquired once they become a child.</p><br><h4>Acquiring language skills</h4><p>Toddlers will automatically have some skill in their parents' native language(s), and will pick up new language skills depending on the language(s) that older sims choose to use with them. Toddlers can also use Simlingo Jr. on any tablet to practice languages that their parents cannot teach them.</p><br><h4>Earning native languages</h4><p>When a toddler becomes a child, any languages at or above level 5 will be acquired as a native language. If no languages meet this threshold, then their highest skill is chosen instead. If they acquire more than one native language, they will also earn the <span class=\"whitespace-nowrap font-bold\"><img class=\"inline-block h-5\" data-src=\"multilingual\" alt=\"multilingual\"> Native Multilingual</span> trait.</p><p class=\"footnote\">The default threshold is 5, but you can change it by following <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/54392738\" target=\"_blank\">this guide on Patreon</a></p></div><br><div class=\"images-md\"><img data-src=\"acquired-one\"> <img data-src=\"acquired-multi\"></div><h2>Language contexts & preferences</h2><div class=\"paragraphs\"><h4>Language contexts</h4><p>Each pair of sims has an agreed-upon language to use with one another (their language context). Which language they use is automatically determined when they first meet, but it can be changed at any time. The language context affects:</p><ul><li>Which social interactions are available</li><li>How often communication events occur</li><li>Which language skills are increased while speaking</li></ul><p>The language context between two sims can be seen in the sim's profile (<strong>Relationships Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Click on Sim</strong> &gt; <strong>Open Sim Profile</strong>), and can be changed by asking to change languages (<strong>Actions</strong> &gt; <strong>Ask to use ...</strong>).</p><p class=\"footnote\">There is a chance the other sim will decline to switch, unless you use the \"Asking to change context always succeeds\" add-on</p><br><div class=\"images-md\"><img data-src=\"context\"> <img data-src=\"context-determined\"></div><br><h4>Language preferences</h4><p>Sims can declare a language preference, and will always use that language with other sims when they meet for the first time.</p><p class=\"footnote\">\"Preference\" does not refer to a CAS preference - it a hidden trait that can be chosen in <strong class=\"text-subtle\">Languages</strong> &gt; <strong class=\"text-subtle\">Language Preference</strong></p></div><h2>Restricted social interactions</h2><div class=\"paragraphs\"><p>If either sim has a low skill in the current language context, some verbal interactions will be unavailable. Interactions gradually become available as each sim increases their skill in the language.</p><p>You can opt-out of this feature for a particular sim by clicking on them and going to <strong>Languages</strong> &gt; <strong>Disable Language Barriers</strong>. Disabling LB for a sim means they will be able to communicate with everyone normally.</p><p class=\"footnote\">Non-verbal interactions, such as hugging or gifting, should never be locked</p></div><h2>Communication events</h2><div class=\"paragraphs\"><p>If two sims are speaking in a language which at least one of them does not speak fluently, there is a chance for a communication event to occur (i.e. accidentally saying something inappropriate or offensive, not being able to understand another sim, speaking too fast, talking down to someone, etc.).</p><p>Communication events can result in either positive or negative buffs, depending on the sim's current mood, traits, and random chance. There are over 150 buffs, but once a sim reacts in a particular mood, they will stick with that mood for a while, and it will gradually get more intense.</p><p class=\"footnote\">Communication buffs will never exceed +4, meaning that you do not have to worry about sims dying from extreme emotions</p></div><br><div class=\"images-md\"><img data-src=\"buff-embarrassed\"> <img data-src=\"buff-tense\"> <img data-src=\"buff-playful\"></div>"},{"title":"Advanced","html":"<h2>Regional languages</h2><div class=\"paragraphs\"><p>Every world has at least one official language, and may have any number of secondary languages. Official languages are used to determine the native languages of sims who live there, and secondary languages are used to determine their default skills. By default, every world has the official language that you would expect from the \"Seven languages\" section in the \"Details\" tab, and their secondary languages are based on my own perception of their real-world equivalents.</p><p class=\"footnote\">You can view all of the default regional languages in the <code>lb_settings.cfg</code> file that is included in the download, and you can customize them by following <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/54392738\" target=\"_blank\">this guide on Patreon</a></p></div><h2>Hidden factors that affect languages</h2><div class=\"paragraphs\"><p>Regional languages only work when sims actually live in a world, meaning they live in a house that is physically located there. This is a problem because some NPC sims are associated with worlds while not actually living there, like the NPCs in Selvadorada. To correct for this, some hidden traits are considered when a sim does not have a home world. Thankfully, EA marks sims from Selvadorada, Mt. Komorebi, and Sulani with hidden traits that signify that they belong to those cultures. I use these traits to \"mark\" sims as Selvadoradian, Komorebigo, and Toki Sulani speakers.</p><p>Additionally, I've added my own hidden traits to the template files that create NPCs, which means that any sims that spawn in for a particular world after you've installed LB will be marked with my own culture traits. When they are marked by these traits, they will receive the associated language.</p><p class=\"footnote\">For example, a sim who spawns in Windenburg will be marked with the Windenburgish culture trait, and will therefore gain the Windenburgish language</p><p>Some other traits, such as \"Geek\", \"Genius\", and \"Lazy\", affect sims' default second language skills. Favorable traits increase their chance of speaking more languages, and speaking them well. Negative traits decrease these chances.</p></div><h2>Language genetics</h2><div class=\"paragraphs\"><p>Languages are organized in a family tree, loosely based off of their real-world counterparts. Language genetics affect how difficult it is for a sim to learn another language, and how likely they are to make mistakes while speaking it.</p><ul><li>Simlish and Windenburgish are very closely related</li><p class=\"footnote\">Based on English and German, which are both Germanic languages</p><li>Selvadoradian and Tartosiano are very closely related</li><p class=\"footnote\">Based on Spanish and Italian, which are both Romance languages</p><li>Simlish/Windenburgish are somewhat related to Selvadoradian/Tartosiano</li><p class=\"footnote\">The Germanic and Romance languages are both European</p><li>Komorebigo and Toki Sulani are somewhat related</li><p class=\"footnote\">Japanese is <em>not</em> related to the Oceanic languages in real life; creative liberty was taken here based on geography</p><li>The \"European\" languages are distantly related to the \"Oceanic\" languages</li><p class=\"footnote\">They're all spoken by humans, after all (yay, more creative liberties)</p><li>Sixami is not related to any of the other languages at all</li><p class=\"footnote\">Alien languages are <span class=\"text-subtle\" title=\"REDACTED BY NASA\">&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;</span>, which means they're <span class=\"text-subtle\" title=\"REDACTED BY NASA\">&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;</span></p></ul></div><h2>Customization options</h2><div class=\"paragraphs\"><p>Language Barriers is highly configurable.</p><ul><li>You can change any sim's native languages or skills if you don't like their defaults</li><p class=\"footnote\">Use the \"Languages\" pie menu option to set a sim's native language(s), and use console cheats for skills</p><li>You can disable Language Barriers for any sim, and they'll be able to communicate like normal</li><p class=\"footnote\">Use the \"Languages\" pie menu option and choose \"Disable Language Barriers\"</p><li>You can change how language assignment, language acquisition, and regional languages work by editing the settings file</li><p class=\"footnote\">No technical skills are required to do this, just follow <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/54392738\" target=\"_blank\">this guide on Patreon</a></p><li>Add-ons are available that can tweak small things that may annoy you</li><p class=\"footnote\">Read the following section about \"Optional add ons\"</p><li>If you're more tech-savvy, Language Barriers is much more customizable with its tuning modules</li><p class=\"footnote\">Feel free to check out and edit the <code>frankk_LanguageBarriers_Data</code> package</p></ul></div><h2>Optional add-ons</h2><div class=\"paragraphs\"><p>These must be downloaded separately on the download page and added to the Language Barriers mod folder:</p><ul><li>Ask to change language always succeeds: <span class=\"text-subtle\">Will make the chance that a sim agrees to speak another language 100%, meaning that you can always guarantee a change in language context without cheating.</span></li><li>Hide all cheats: <span class=\"text-subtle\">Will mark all of the interactions in the \"Languages\" menu as actual cheats, so that you have to shift-click sims to see them. This is helpful for decluttering your pie menus, if it bothers you.</span></li><li>Hide communication notifications: <span class=\"text-subtle\">Will prevent communication notifications (e.g. \"Accidentally Said Something Inappropriate\") from being shown, if they annoy you. These appear every time a communication event occurs, which can be very frequent if two sims do not share a language.</span></li><li>Hide language context notifications: <span class=\"text-subtle\">Will prevent language context notifications (e.g. \"Language Context Determined\") from being shown, if they annoy you. These generally appear whenever you meet a sim for the first time.</span></li><li>Hide Sixami from Simlingo: <span class=\"text-subtle\">Will turn the Simlingo interactions for Sixami into cheats, so you will not see them while playing the game normally. This is useful if you do not wish to play with the occult language, or find it unrealistic that such a language would be available to study online.</span></li></ul></div><h2>Integration with other mods</h2><div class=\"paragraphs\"><p>Interaction locking will <em>kinda</em> work with CC interactions that are in the friendly, funny, mischief, mean, or romance categories. Some mis-matches can occur, though: (1) if they are non-verbal, they may be locked, (2) if they are in their own CC categories, they will not be affected at all.</p><p>In order for LB to work properly with another mod that adds social interactions, either I or its creator has to make an integration for it. Integrations are small files that tell LB which interactions to lock or not. If you want to see LB better integrated with another mod, just let me know.</p><p class=\"footnote\">A guide on how to create an integration can be <a href=\"https://frankkmods.medium.com/how-to-integrate-your-mod-with-language-barriers-a1680c7bceab\" target=\"_blank\">found here</a></p><p>The only integrations that are currently available are for <a href=\"https://littlemssam.tumblr.com/post/175413426238/simda-dating-app-simda-dating-app-can-help-you\" target=\"_blank\">SimDa Dating App by LittleMsSam</a> and <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/nc4t-mod-48682571\" target=\"_blank\">Pickpocketing Mod by NeedCoffee4That</a>.

Doing so would break the immersion of the game.</p><p class=\"footnote\">If you are a <a href=\"#/donate\" target=\"_blank\">top-tier patron</a>, you are allowed to request a personalized mod version, including custom language names.</p><h2>Can you add language classes/learning a language at school?</h2><p>If you have High School Years, your teenagers can choose which language they want to study in their \"foreign language class\".</p><p class=\"footnote\">Classes for kids/uni students and BG-compatibility for teens is planned for a future update.</p><h2>Why can't I set the language for destination worlds?</h2><div class=\"paragraphs\"><p>Destination worlds do not work with the way that I currently assign languages to sims, because no one technically lives there. If EA ever makes destination worlds livable, I will allow you to customize them.</p><p>If you would like to change the languages for destination worlds anyways, perhaps because you're using Zerbu's \"All Worlds are Residential\" mod, you can manually add them to the <code>lb_settings.cfg</code> file. Just use the names \"Granite Falls\", \"Selvadorada\", and \"Batuu\".</p></div><h2>Can you add a language for Batuu?</h2><p>Read the previous FAQ to understand why it's currently not possible. But more importantly, I know nothing about Star Wars, and feel like I would not implement it well, and it would get in the way of that pack's gameplay.</p><h2>Can a world have multiple languages that sims can speak natively?</h2><p>Yes.
