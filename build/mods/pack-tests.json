You only have to install it once.</p><h2>What if I have every pack?</h2><p>You still need to install this mod if using another that requires it.</p><p class=\"footnote\">This script allows modders to write code that the game cannot understand on its own, so leaving this mod out can cause issues while loading their files.</p>"},{"title":"For Modders","html":"<p class=\"text-subtle\"><span class=\"danger font-bold\">STOP!</span> Before you consider using this mod, you should check out <a href=\"https://lot51.cc/core\" target=\"_blank\">Lot51's Core Library</a>. It supports many features, including pack tests.</p><h2>What can this mod do for me?</h2><p>This mod adds a tunable test set that can check whether certain packs are installed or not. You can then reference these test sets anywhere you normally would (e.g. in a loot, interaction, etc.). This is all done via tuning, so you do not have to write a script of your own.</p><h2>How often will this mod be updated?</h2><p>This mod is only updated when absolutely necessary (i.e. when it breaks after a patch), and these are just updates to the script. So, you should never have to update your tuning when this mod updates - your users just have to update this mod.</p><h2>How can I use this mod?</h2><div class=\"paragraphs\"><p>Download the modders' documentation to get started - it will show you how you can write and use your own pack test sets.</p><p><span class=\"font-bold\">Do not include my script in your own download, and do not re-upload it anywhere</span>*. Doing so will inevitably lead to users having the same code in their game multiple times, and it will cause issues for them if this mod is ever updated.</p><p class=\"footnote\">*If you'd like to implement your own pack test based on my code, you are 100% free to do so. Just do not copy the files exactly as-is, or we may have conflicts.</p></div>"},{"title":"Changelog","html":"<h2>1.0.1 (July 20, 2021)</h2><ul><li>Fix issue that resulted from the Cottage Living patch.</li></ul><h2>1.0 (January 4, 2021)</h2><ul><li>Add pack test set.</li></ul>"}],"documentation":[{"host":"Sim File Share","href":"http://www.simfileshare.net/download/2251516/"}],"downloads":[{"host":"Sim File Share","href":"http://www.simfileshare.net/download/2251515/"},{"host":"Google Drive","href":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19Xw1Yt1FEvT2AzZmnq7dYwe6ImgDZKiv?usp=sharing"}]}
