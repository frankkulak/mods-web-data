<h2>What does this mod do?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Whenever a sim does anything, there is a chance for the outcome of their
    action to be randomized.
  </li>
  <p class="footnote">
    1 out of every 400 random outcomes will involve fire, but the other 399 can
    be anything from a notification to an alien abduction.
  </p>
  <li>
    Random outcomes also count as actions, and can trigger even more randomness.
  </li>
  <p class="footnote">When it rains, it pours. Have fun.</p>

<h2>Warnings & known issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    For some reason, the randomizer <em>loves</em> picking outcomes related to
    skeletons and chickens. This is not a joke. You'll see what I mean.
  </li>
  <p class="footnote">
    <strong>Tip</strong>: To reduce notification spam from the mystical baby
    chicken,
    <a href="https://jamesturner.yt/disablepacks" target="_blank"
      >disable the Cottage Living EP</a
    >.
  </p>
  <li>
    Other gameplay mods may perform actions in the background, and cause an
    unbearable amount of randomized outcomes.
  </li>
  <p class="footnote">
    <strong>Tip</strong>: Remove other gameplay mods before playing with Utter
    Chaos.
  </p>
  <li>
    You <em>will</em> see "exception" notifications if you use MC Command Center
    or Better Exceptions, due to the high degree of randomness this mod
    produces.
  </li>
  <p class="footnote">
    <strong>Tip</strong>: This is unavoidable, and may be annoying. Consider
    removing these mods while using Utter Chaos.
