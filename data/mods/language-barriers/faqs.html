<h2>Do the languages sound different when spoken?</h2>
<p>
  No, and they probably never will - I do not think this is something that is
  possible.
</p>

<h2>Can you add a real language?</h2>
<p>
  No, I do not add real languages to the mod. Doing so would break the immersion
  of the game.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  If you are a <a href="#/donate" target="_blank">top-tier patron</a>, you are
  allowed to request a personalized mod version, including custom language
  names.

<h2>Can you add language classes/learning a language at school?</h2>
<p>
  If you have High School Years, your teenagers can choose which language they
  want to study in their "foreign language class".
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  Classes for kids/uni students and BG-compatibility for teens is planned for a
  future update.

<h2>Why can't I set the language for destination worlds?</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    Destination worlds do not work with the way that I currently assign
    languages to sims, because no one technically lives there. If EA ever makes
    destination worlds livable, I will allow you to customize them.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you would like to change the languages for destination worlds anyways,
    perhaps because you're using Zerbu's "All Worlds are Residential" mod, you
    can manually add them to the <code>lb_settings.cfg</code> file. Just use the
    names "Granite Falls", "Selvadorada", and "Batuu".
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Can you add a language for Batuu?</h2>
<p>
  Read the previous FAQ to understand why it's currently not possible. But more
  importantly, I know nothing about Star Wars, and feel like I would not
  implement it well, and it would get in the way of that pack's gameplay.
</p>

<h2>Can a world have multiple languages that sims can speak natively?</h2>
<p>
  Yes. Please read

  to learn how this works.

<h2>Can you add a language for spellcasters/vampires?</h2>
<p>
  This is planned for the future, but will work a bit differently.
  Spellcasters/vampires will still have their primary native language(s), and
  the occult languages will be minor skills that can be used to cast spells,
  read tomes, etc.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  This is likely at least 2 major updates away from being added.

<h2>Can you make Sixami more exclusive / remove it Simlingo?</h2>
<p>
  I have created an add-on to get rid of Sixami from Simlingo. Download it from
  the "Add Ons" folder on the download page.
