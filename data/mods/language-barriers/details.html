<h2>Native vs. learned languages</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    Each language has a trait and a skill. The traits are for native speakers
    (L1), and the skills are for second language learners (L2).
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    Traits are added automatically in the background or by using cheats - they
    are not in CAS. Skills can be acquired through different activities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Native speakers are fluent in a language because they grew up speaking it,
    while second language learners have varying degrees of fluency depending on
    the level of their skill. Most sims will only have one native language, but
    children who grow up speaking multiple languages may be multilingual. These
    multilingual sims earn the

    trait, which helps them learn second languages faster than other sims.

<h2>Automatic language assignment</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    Language traits/skills are automatically added to sims (children and older)
    when they first spawn into the world while LB is installed.
  </p>

  <br />
  <h4>Native language traits</h4>
  <p>
    A sim's default native language(s) are determined by their home world, their
    traits/occult type, and the language(s) their parents speak. If they have
    more than one native language, they gain the

      Native Multilingual</span
    >
    trait as well.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    Sims are guaranteed to have at least one native language. Their native
    language(s) can only be changed through cheats.
  </p>

  <br />
  <h4>Second language skills</h4>
  <p>
    A sim's default second language(s) are determined by their native
    language(s), home world, traits/occult type, and the language(s) their
    parents and romantic partner speak. How well they speak each language (i.e.
    the level of their skill, from 1 to 10) is determined by its genetic
    closeness to their native language(s), their traits, their age, and some
    other factors.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    Sims are guaranteed to have at least one language in common with their
    parents and partner. If they don't share a native language, they will
    acquire the other's as a skill.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Toddler language acquisition</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    Babies and toddlers do not have native languages - they are acquired once
    they become a child.
  </p>

  <br />
  <h4>Acquiring language skills</h4>
  <p>
    Toddlers will automatically have some skill in their parents' native
    language(s), and will pick up new language skills depending on the
    language(s) that older sims choose to use with them. Toddlers can also use
    Simlingo Jr. on any tablet to practice languages that their parents cannot
    teach them.
  </p>

  <br />
  <h4>Earning native languages</h4>
  <p>
    When a toddler becomes a child, any languages at or above level 5 will be
    acquired as a native language. If no languages meet this threshold, then
    their highest skill is chosen instead. If they acquire more than one native
    language, they will also earn the

    trait.
