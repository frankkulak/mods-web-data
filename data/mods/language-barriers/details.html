<h2>Summary</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    Language Barriers is a fairly complex mod that adds several languages to the
    game. Sims can either speak these languages natively (with traits), or study
    them as second languages (with skills). Their communication options with
    other sims is limited based on their knowledge of these languages, and they
    may accidentally insult, enrage, or confuse the sims they are speaking with.

  <p class="danger">
    <strong class="danger">Be advised</strong>: Some social interactions will be
    hidden for particular pairs of sims. This is an intended feature, not a bug.

<h2>Native vs. learned languages</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    Each language has a trait and a skill. The traits are for native speakers
    (L1), and the skills are for second language learners (L2).
  </p>
  <p>
    These traits are added automatically in the background or by using cheats
    (they are not in CAS). The skills can be acquired by studying on Simlingo
    (phone/computer/tablet), reading a textbook (bookshelf), or by talking to
    sims who know another language.
  </p>
  <p>
    Native speakers are fluent in a language because they grew up speaking it,
    while second language learners have varying degrees of fluency depending on
    the level of their skill. Most sims will only have one native language, but
    children who grow up speaking multiple languages may be multilingual. These
    multilingual sims earn the

    trait, which helps them learn second languages faster than other sims.

<h2>Automatic language assignment</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    Language traits/skills are automatically added to sims (children and older)
    when they first spawn into the world while LB is installed.
  </p>

  <br />
  <h4>Native language traits</h4>
  <p>
    A sim's default native language(s) are determined by their home world, their
    traits/occult type, and the language(s) their parents speak. If they have
    more than one native language, they gain the
    <span class="whitespace-nowrap font-bold">
      <img
        class="inline-block h-5"
        data-src="multilingual"

      />
      Native Multilingual</span
    >
    trait as well.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    Sims are guaranteed to have at least one native language. Their native
    language(s) can only be changed through cheats.
  </p>

  <br />
  <h4>Second language skills</h4>
  <p>
    A sim's default second language(s) are determined by their native
    language(s), home world, traits/occult type, and the language(s) their
    parents and romantic partner speak. How well they speak each language (i.e.
    the level of their skill, from 1 to 10) is determined by its genetic
    closeness to their native language(s), their traits, their age, and some
    other factors.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    Sims are guaranteed to have at least one language in common with their
    parents and partner. If they don't share a native language, they will
    acquire the other's as a skill.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Toddler language acquisition</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    Babies and toddlers do not have native languages - they are acquired once
    they become a child.
  </p>

  <br />
  <h4>Acquiring language skills</h4>
  <p>
    Toddlers will automatically have some skill in their parents' native
    language(s), and will pick up new language skills depending on the
    language(s) that older sims choose to use with them. Toddlers can also use
    Simlingo Jr. on any tablet to practice languages that their parents cannot
    teach them.
  </p>

  <br />
  <h4>Earning native languages</h4>
  <p>
    When a toddler becomes a child, any languages at or above level 5 will be
    acquired as a native language. If no languages meet this threshold, then
    their highest skill is chosen instead. If they acquire more than one native
    language, they will also earn the

    trait.
  </p>

    The default threshold is 5, but you can change it by following

<h2>Language contexts & preferences</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <h4>Language contexts</h4>
  <p>
    Each pair of sims has an agreed-upon language to use with one another (their
    language context). Which language they use is automatically determined when
    they first meet, but it can be changed at any time. The language context
    affects:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Which social interactions are available</li>
    <li>How often communication events occur</li>
    <li>Which language skills are increased while speaking</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The language context between two sims can be seen in the sim's profile
    (<strong>Relationships Panel</strong> &gt;
    <strong>Click on Sim</strong> &gt; <strong>Open Sim Profile</strong>), and
    can be changed by asking to change languages (<strong>Actions</strong> &gt;
    <strong>Ask to use ...</strong>).
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    There is a chance the other sim will decline to switch, unless you use the
    "Asking to change context always succeeds" add-on
  </p>

  <br />
  <div class="images-md">
    <img data-src="context" />
    <img data-src="context-determined" />
  </div>

  <br />
  <h4>Language preferences</h4>
  <p>
    Sims can declare a language preference, and will always use that language
    with other sims when they meet for the first time.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    "Preference" does not refer to a CAS preference - it a hidden trait that can
    be chosen in <strong class="text-subtle">Languages</strong> &gt;
    <strong class="text-subtle">Language Preference</strong>
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Restricted social interactions</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    If either sim has a low skill in the current language context, some verbal
    interactions will be unavailable. Interactions gradually become available as
    each sim increases their skill in the language.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can opt-out of this feature for a particular sim by clicking on them and
    going to <strong>Languages</strong> &gt;
    <strong>Disable Language Barriers</strong>. Disabling LB for a sim means
    they will be able to communicate with everyone normally.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    Non-verbal interactions, such as hugging or gifting, should never be locked
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Communication events</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    If two sims are speaking in a language which at least one of them does not
    speak fluently, there is a chance for a communication event to occur (i.e.
    accidentally saying something inappropriate or offensive, not being able to
    understand another sim, speaking too fast, talking down to someone, etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
    Communication events can result in either positive or negative buffs,
    depending on the sim's current mood, traits, and random chance. There are
    over 150 buffs, but once a sim reacts in a particular mood, they will stick
    with that mood for a while, and it will gradually get more intense.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    Communication buffs will never exceed +4, meaning that you do not have to
    worry about sims dying from extreme emotions
