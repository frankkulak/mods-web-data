<h2>Regional languages</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    Every world has at least one official language, and may have any number of
    secondary languages. Official languages are used to determine the native
    languages of sims who live there, and secondary languages are used to
    determine their default skills. By default, every world has the official
    language that you would expect from the "Seven languages" section in the
    "Details" tab, and their secondary languages are based on my own perception
    of their real-world equivalents.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    You can view all of the default regional languages in the
    <code>lb_settings.cfg</code> file that is included in the download, and you
    can customize them by following

<h2>Hidden factors that affect languages</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    Regional languages only work when sims actually live in a world, meaning
    they live in a house that is physically located there. This is a problem
    because some NPC sims are associated with worlds while not actually living
    there, like the NPCs in Selvadorada. To correct for this, some hidden traits
    are considered when a sim does not have a home world. Thankfully, EA marks
    sims from Selvadorada, Mt. Komorebi, and Sulani with hidden traits that
    signify that they belong to those cultures. I use these traits to "mark"
    sims as Selvadoradian, Komorebigo, and Toki Sulani speakers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, I've added my own hidden traits to the template files that
    create NPCs, which means that any sims that spawn in for a particular world
    after you've installed LB will be marked with my own culture traits. When
    they are marked by these traits, they will receive the associated language.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    For example, a sim who spawns in Windenburg will be marked with the
    Windenburgish culture trait, and will therefore gain the Windenburgish
    language
  </p>
  <p>
    Some other traits, such as "Geek", "Genius", and "Lazy", affect sims'
    default second language skills. Favorable traits increase their chance of
    speaking more languages, and speaking them well. Negative traits decrease
    these chances.

<h2>Language genetics</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    Languages are organized in a family tree, loosely based off of their
    real-world counterparts. Language genetics affect how difficult it is for a
    sim to learn another language, and how likely they are to make mistakes
    while speaking it.
