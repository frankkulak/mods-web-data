<h2>Regional languages</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    Every world has at least one official language, and may have any number of
    secondary languages. Official languages are used to determine the native
    languages of sims who live there, and secondary languages are used to
    determine their default skills. By default, every world has the official
    language that you would expect from the "Seven languages" section in the
    "Details" tab, and their secondary languages are based on my own perception
    of their real-world equivalents.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    You can view all of the default regional languages in the
    <code>lb_settings.cfg</code> file that is included in the download, and you
    can customize them by following

<h2>Hidden factors that affect languages</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    Regional languages only work when sims actually live in a world, meaning
    they live in a house that is physically located there. This is a problem
    because some NPC sims are associated with worlds while not actually living
    there, like the NPCs in Selvadorada. To correct for this, some hidden traits
    are considered when a sim does not have a home world. Thankfully, EA marks
    sims from Selvadorada, Mt. Komorebi, and Sulani with hidden traits that
    signify that they belong to those cultures. I use these traits to "mark"
    sims as Selvadoradian, Komorebigo, and Toki Sulani speakers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, I've added my own hidden traits to the template files that
    create NPCs, which means that any sims that spawn in for a particular world
    after you've installed LB will be marked with my own culture traits. When
    they are marked by these traits, they will receive the associated language.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    For example, a sim who spawns in Windenburg will be marked with the
    Windenburgish culture trait, and will therefore gain the Windenburgish
    language
  </p>
  <p>
    Some other traits, such as "Geek", "Genius", and "Lazy", affect sims'
    default second language skills. Favorable traits increase their chance of
    speaking more languages, and speaking them well. Negative traits decrease
    these chances.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Language genetics</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    Languages are organized in a family tree, loosely based off of their
    real-world counterparts. Language genetics affect how difficult it is for a
    sim to learn another language, and how likely they are to make mistakes
    while speaking it.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Simlish and Windenburgish are very closely related</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Based on English and German, which are both Germanic languages
    </p>
    <li>Selvadoradian and Tartosiano are very closely related</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Based on Spanish and Italian, which are both Romance languages
    </p>
    <li>
      Simlish/Windenburgish are somewhat related to Selvadoradian/Tartosiano
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">The Germanic and Romance languages are both European</p>
    <li>Tomaru and Toki Sulani are closely related</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Both are based on Austronesian languages of Southeast Asia and the Pacific
    </p>
    <li>Komorebigois somewhat related to Tomaru/Toki Sulani</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Japanese is <em>not</em> related to the Austronesian languages in real
      life; creative liberty was taken here based on geography
    </p>
    <li>
      The "European" languages are distantly related to the "Austronesian"
      languages
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      They're all spoken by humans, after all (yay, more creative liberties)
    </p>
    <li>Sixami is not related to any of the other languages at all</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Alien languages are
      <span class="text-subtle" title="REDACTED BY NASA"
        >&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;</span
      >, which means they're

  <p>Language Barriers is highly configurable.</p>
  <ul>

      You can change any sim's native languages or skills if you don't like
      their defaults

    <p class="footnote">
      Use the "Languages" pie menu option to set a sim's native language(s), and
      use console cheats for skills
    </p>
    <li>
      You can disable Language Barriers for any sim, and they'll be able to
      communicate like normal
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Use the "Languages" pie menu option and choose "Disable Language Barriers"

    <li>
      You can change how language assignment, language acquisition, and regional
      languages work by editing the settings file

<h2>Optional add-ons</h2>

  <p>
    These must be downloaded separately on the download page and added to the

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ask to change language always succeeds:
      <span class="text-subtle"
        >Will make the chance that a sim agrees to speak another language 100%,
        meaning that you can always guarantee a change in language context
        without cheating.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      Hide all cheats:
      <span class="text-subtle"
        >Will mark all of the interactions in the "Languages" menu as actual
        cheats, so that you have to shift-click sims to see them. This is
        helpful for decluttering your pie menus, if it bothers you.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      Hide communication notifications:
      <span class="text-subtle"
        >Will prevent communication notifications (e.g. "Accidentally Said
        Something Inappropriate") from being shown, if they annoy you. These
        appear every time a communication event occurs, which can be very
        frequent if two sims do not share a language.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      Hide language context notifications:
      <span class="text-subtle"
        >Will prevent language context notifications (e.g. "Language Context
        Determined") from being shown, if they annoy you. These generally appear
        whenever you meet a sim for the first time.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      Hide Sixami from Simlingo:
      <span class="text-subtle"
        >Will turn the Simlingo interactions for Sixami into cheats, so you will
        not see them while playing the game normally. This is useful if you do
        not wish to play with the occult language, or find it unrealistic that
        such a language would be available to study online.</span

<h2>Integration with other mods</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    Interaction locking will <em>kinda</em> work with CC interactions that are
    in the friendly, funny, mischief, mean, or romance categories. Some
    mis-matches can occur, though: (1) if they are non-verbal, they may be
    locked, (2) if they are in their own CC categories, they will not be
    affected at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order for LB to work properly with another mod that adds social
    interactions, either I or its creator has to make an integration for it.
    Integrations are small files that tell LB which interactions to lock or not.
    If you want to see LB better integrated with another mod, just let me know.

  <h4>Hidden trait cheats</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>

      isn't work right.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>fklb.debug</code> &rarr; Toggles debug mode. Debug mode outputs more
      information to the log file, and is helpful for me to figure out what the

    <li>
      <code>fklb.total_reset</code> &rarr; The nuclear option. Resets any and

      This should only be used if you suspect that something has gone very wrong
      with the mod, and you want to reset it without uninstalling and
      reinstalling. If you ever feel you need to use this cheat, please reach
      out to me on Discord so I can figure out the cause of what's going wrong
      with your game.
