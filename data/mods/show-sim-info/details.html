<h2>Why is this mod on this website?</h2>
<p>
  Show Sim Info broke after the July 26, 2022 patch for the High School Years
  pack, and its original creator, Itasan, no longer updates it. This is a very
  important mod for many modders and players, so I fixed it myself and wanted to
  share it with others.

  <span class="font-bold text-subtle">To Itasan</span>: I assumed that you would
  be alright with someone else maintaining your mod because you have not been
  active in a couple of years. If this is not the case, please reach out to me
  and I will remove it from my website.
