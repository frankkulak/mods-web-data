  <h2>What does this mod do?</h2>
  <p>
    This mod lets you change any sim's occult type during live mode via a cheat
    interaction. You can switch between: <strong>Human (Non-Occult)</strong>,
    <strong>Alien</strong>, <strong>Vampire</strong>, <strong>Mermaid</strong>,
    <strong>Spellcaster</strong>, and <strong>Werewolf</strong>. Hybrid occult
    types are not supported.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    PlantSims, Ghosts, Skeletons, and Servos are not yet supported.
  </p>

  <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
  <p>
    To access the cheat interaction, you must first enable testing cheats with
    the
    <code>testingcheats on</code> cheat code (note that this cheat is per-save).
    When testing cheats are on, shift-click the sim you'd like to edit, and
    select the <strong>Change Occult Type...</strong> interaction.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    To enter a cheat code: (1) Press CTRL + SHIFT + C, (2) Type the cheat code,
    (3) Press enter.

  <h2>What happens when I use this cheat?</h2>
  <p>
    The chosen sim will immediately turn into the selected occult, leaving their
    previous occult form(s) behind. However, occult appearances and progression
    trees are not disturbed - you can switch back to the original occult form at
    any time and pick up where you left off.
  </p>
  <p class="danger">
    <strong>Important:</strong> If used on a hybrid occult, you will not be able
    to get their hybrid status back.

  <h2>What if I don't have all occult packs?</h2>
  <p>
    No problem. If you don't have the packs for certain occult types, they
    simply won't appear as options.
