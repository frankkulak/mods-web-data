<h2>Automatic followers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Gain followers when you gain fame.</li>
  <p class="footnote">
    Interactions that add followers: Selling a painting or photo, making an app
    or game, licensing a song or lyrics, publishing a book, being nominated for
    an award, accepting an award, completing a work day as an actor, ranking up
    as a celebrity, and getting positive PR through the PR agency.
  </p>
  <li>Lose followers when you lose fame.</li>
  <p class="footnote">
    Interactions that remove followers: Ranking down as a celebrity and getting
    bad PR through the PR agency.
  </p>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
  Exact amounts for gains/losses are random, but are influenced by the sim's
  interaction, current fame rank, and current follower count.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  Example: A non-famous sim with 10 followers will gain very few for a painting,
  but a famous sim with 10 million followers will gain hundreds of thousands for
  a movie.
</p>

<h2>Initial followers for famous sims</h2>
<p>
  When you first load a save with this mod installed, all of your famous sims
  will have their follower counts checked. If they do not have any followers,
  then they will be given a random amount that corresponds with their fame
  level.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  1 star = ~1k, 2 stars = ~10k, 3 stars = ~100k, 4 stars = ~1M, 5 stars = ~10M
</p>

<h2>Customization & cheats</h2>
<p>
  For all of the following, you will need to enable testing cheats with the
  <code>testingcheats on</code> command.
</p>
<br />
<h4>Disabling automatic followers for a sim</h4>
<p>
  All sims have auto followers on by default, but you can turn it off for
  specific sims by shift-clicking them and selecting the "Follower Cheats" menu
  option.
</p>
<br />
<h4>Manually add/remove followers</h4>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    You can add/remove followers with interactions by shift-clicking a sim and
    going to the "Follower Cheats" menu option.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alternatively, you can also use the following console cheats. They each
    accept 3 arguments, the first being the number of followers, the second
    being the sim's first name, and the third being their last name.
