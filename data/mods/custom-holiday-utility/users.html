    It fixes existing problems with modded holidays, which are explained in
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/84572301"
      >this Patreon post</a
    >. Specifically, it:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Makes it easy for modders to add custom holidays in a safe way</li>
    <li>Allows custom holidays to appear in existing saves</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      Use the cheat <code>chu.add_missing_holidays</code> to add all newly
      installed holidays to a save
    </p>
    <li>Fixes an error that occurs after uninstalling custom holidays</li>
    <p class="footnote">
      <span class="font-bold danger">Important:</span> For this to work, this
      mod must be kept in your game even after uninstalling custom holidays. It
      works by detecting when the custom holiday is no longer installed. You can
      remove this mod after uninstalling the holiday, launching your game, and
      saving.
    </p>
  </ul>

  <h2>Should I install this mod?</h2>
  <p>
    If you are downloading a mod that lists this one as a requirement, then yes.
    If you want any modded holidays to appear in existing saves, or if you're
    uninstalling them and don't want to be harassed by an exception
    notification, then also yes.
