<h2>What can this mod do for me?</h2>
<p>
  This mod makes it easy for you to add custom holidays to the calendar in a
  safer way, using a snippet - no scripting required. It also ensures that your
  holiday will appear in existing saves, and that it does not cause exceptions
  when uninstalled.

<h2>How can I use this mod?</h2>
<p>
  Download the modders' documentation to get started - it will show you how you
  can write and use your holiday injector snippet.

<h2 class="danger">Important notice</h2>
<p>
  Do not include my script in your own download, and do not re-upload it
  anywhere. Doing so will inevitably lead to users having the same code in their
  game multiple times, and it <span class="font-bold">WILL</span> cause issues.
  Remember, this is not just an injector, but also a fix.
