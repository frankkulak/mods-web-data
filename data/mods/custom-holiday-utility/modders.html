<h2>What can this mod do for me?</h2>
<p>
  This mod makes it easy for you to add custom holidays to the calendar without
  overriding the Seasons files (just write a snippet - no scripting required).
  It also allows your holidays to be added to existing saves, and that it does
  not cause exceptions when uninstalled.
</p>

<h2>How can I use this mod?</h2>
<p>
  Go to the modder's documentation, which is just a sample snippet. If you've
  ever written tuning before, then you'll be able to figure it out. For a
  complete example, check out my

<h2 class="danger">Important notice</h2>
<p>
  Do not include my script in your own download, and do not re-upload it
  anywhere. Doing so will inevitably lead to users having the same code in their
  game multiple times, and it <span class="font-bold">WILL</span> cause issues.
  Remember, this is not just an injector, but also a fix for an exception.
