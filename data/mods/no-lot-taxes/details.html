  <h2>What does this mod do?</h2>
  <p>This mod makes property taxes cost ยง0. That's it.</p>
  <p class="footnote">
    You'll still owe other bills/utilities, like power and water.
  </p>
  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <p>
    Other small mods that alter bills are most likely doing so by overriding a
    tuning module, which makes them more susceptible to breaking after game
    patches. This one works with a script, so it is less likely to require
    updates often.

  <strong>Please note:</strong> If there are already bills in your mailbox, this
  mod will not affect them. It only works on new bills that are delivered while
  the mod is installed.
