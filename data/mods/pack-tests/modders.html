  Before you consider using this mod, you should check out
  <a href="https://lot51.cc/core" target="_blank">Lot51's Core Library</a>. It
  supports many features, including pack tests.
</p>

<h2>What can this mod do for me?</h2>
<p>
  This mod adds a tunable test set that can check whether certain packs are
  installed or not. You can then reference these test sets anywhere you normally
  would (e.g. in a loot, interaction, etc.). This is all done via tuning, so you
  do not have to write a script of your own.
</p>

<h2>How often will this mod be updated?</h2>
<p>
  This mod is only updated when absolutely necessary (i.e. when it breaks after
  a patch), and these are just updates to the script. So, you should never have
  to update your tuning when this mod updates - your users just have to update
  this mod.
</p>

<h2>How can I use this mod?</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    Download the modders' documentation to get started - it will show you how
    you can write and use your own pack test sets.

    <span class="font-bold"
      >Do not include my script in your own download, and do not re-upload it
      anywhere</span
    >*. Doing so will inevitably lead to users having the same code in their
    game multiple times, and it will cause issues for them if this mod is ever
    updated.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    *If you'd like to implement your own pack test based on my code, you are
    100% free to do so. Just do not copy the files exactly as-is, or we may have
    conflicts.
