<h2>What does this mod do?</h2>
<p>
  It makes it easier for modders to check whether you have certain packs
  installed. This is done to integrate mods with packs while keeping them
  compatible with the base game.
</p>

<h2>Should I install this mod?</h2>
<p>
  Only if you're using another mod that requires it (its creator should tell
  you). You only have to install it once.
</p>

<h2>What if I have every pack?</h2>
<p>
  You still need to install this mod if using another that requires it. This mod
  allows modders to write code that the game cannot understand on its own, so
  using their mod without this one will cause issues.
