  "Simway" has been a work-in-progress for
  <em>years</em>, and has been paused while I focus on other things, such as
  <a href="https://sims4toolkit.com" target="_blank">Sims 4 Toolkit</a>. I am
  pleased to announce it it now back in full-swing development, and is my
  primary focus. There is no estimated release date at this time.

  <h2>Planned features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>At least three different MLMs for your sims to be a part of.</li>
    <li>
      You may be approached by MLM members who want to sell products or recruit
      you.
    </li>
    <li>You can earn money by selling products or recruiting other sims.</li>
    <li>
      You have to pay a startup fee to join an MLM and a portion of your profits
      to remain in it. Want out? Have fun with that :)
    </li>
    <li>Host and attend "selling parties" for custom MLM products.</li>
  </ul>
