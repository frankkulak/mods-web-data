  This mod is an idea I had a while back, and has been a "work in progress" for
  <em>years</em>. I have been focused on other things, such as
  <a href="https://sims4toolkit.com" target="_blank">Sims 4 Toolkit</a>, and
  have therefore not been making progress on it. There is no estimated release
  date at this time, but I do still plan on finishing it. Apologies for the
  massive delay, I know people have been looking forward to it.

<h2>Planned features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>At least three different MLMs for your sims to be a part of.</li>
  <li>
    You may be approached by an MLM member who wants to sell products to you,
    recruit you, or both.
  </li>
  <li>
    You have to pay a startup fee to join an MLM and a portion of your profits
    to remain in it.
  </li>
  <li>You can earn money by selling products or recruiting other sims.</li>
  <li>Host and attend "selling parties" for MLM products.</li>
  <li>
    Various MLMs may pop up every now and then to wreak havoc on your sims.
  </li>
</ul>
