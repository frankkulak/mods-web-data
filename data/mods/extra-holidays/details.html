  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This mod adds "Spookyfest" and "Flower Day" holidays to the calendar. That's
    it, ta-da ðŸŽ‰.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    You can pick and choose which holidays you want to install, and even rename
    them with the <code>HolidayNames.cfg</code> file.

  <h2>Flower Day</h2>
  <div class="collapse-split-view">
    <div>
      <p>
        Flower Day occurs during Spring, and is observed by a day off of work
        and school on Mondays.
      </p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Schedule</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>7 day seasons &rarr; Monday of week 1</li>
        <li>14 day seasons &rarr; Monday of week 1</li>
        <li>28 day seasons &rarr; Monday of week 2</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4 footnote">
        Though it is based on Easter, Monday was chosen instead of Sunday
        because (1) Sunday holidays do not work when you start in that season,
        (2) being on Sunday would put Flower Day on New Year's Day, and (3) this
        way you can have the day after off of work and school.
