  <h2>Flower Day</h2>
  <div class="collapse-split-view">
    <div>
      <p>Occurs during Spring. Comes with a day off from work and school.</p>

      <p class="mt-4 footnote">
        Though it is based on Easter, Monday was chosen instead of Sunday
        because (1) Sunday holidays do not work when you start in that season,
        (2) being on Sunday would put Flower Day on New Year's Day, and (3) this
        way you can have the day after off of work and school.
