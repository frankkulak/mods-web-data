  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This mod adds "Spookyfest" and "Flower Day" holidays to the calendar. You
    can pick and choose, so if you only want one, just install one.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong class="danger font-bold">Important:</strong> This mod requires my
    <a target="_blank" href="#/mods/custom-holiday-utility"
      >Custom Holiday Utility</a
    >
    mod. You must install it as well, or Extra Holidays will not work.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    If you report that Extra Holidays isn't working and I find out you do not
    have Custom Holiday Utility installed, I will kick you from my server.

  <div class="collapse-split-view">

      <p>
        Flower Day occurs during Spring, and is observed by a day off of work
        and school on Mondays.
      </p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Schedule</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>7 day seasons &rarr; Monday of week 1</li>
        <li>14 day seasons &rarr; Monday of week 1</li>
        <li>28 day seasons &rarr; Monday of week 2</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4 footnote">
        Though it is based on Easter, Monday was chosen instead of Sunday
        because (1) Sunday holidays do not work when you start in that season,
        (2) being on Sunday would put Flower Day on New Year's Day, and (3) this
        way you can have the day after off of work and school.
