  <h2>Schedule</h2>
  <p>
    Halloween is scheduled during Fall. The exact day depends on your Season
    length:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>7 days &rarr; Monday of week 1</li>
    <li>14 days &rarr; Friday of week 1</li>
    <li>28 days &rarr; Friday of week 3</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mt-4 footnote">
    This schedule ensures that Halloween occurs before Harvestfest, which is
    always the last Thursday of Fall.
