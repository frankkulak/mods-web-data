  <h2>What does this mod do?</h2>
  <p>It silences "Discovery Quest" phone calls and notifications. That's it.</p>

  <h2>Isn't this in my game settings?</h2>
  <p>Yes, but it does not prevent popups that have already been scheduled.</p>
  <p class="footnote">
    Your existing save(s) likely already have quite a few of these.
  </p>
  <p>This mod has two advantages over the setting:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It silences Discovery Quests by default, in every save</li>
    <li>It works on Discovery Quests that have already been scheduled</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Known issues</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      This mod also silences Reaper's Rewards popups, as they are implemented as
      Discovery Quests.
    </li>
  </ul>
