<h2>What does this mod do?</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    I put all of the text in the game through a translator several times, and
    this mod replaces the original text with it.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote">Yup, that's it. It's just for dumb fun.</p>
</div>

<h2>Two versions: clean &amp; explicit</h2>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>
    The translator occasionally outputs vulgar language, so I've prepared two
    versions of this mod:
  </p>
  <ul class="my-2">
    <li>
      <strong>Clean</strong>: All vulgar language has been replaced with milder
      terms
    </li>
    <p class="footnote">
      This removes all swears, sexual terms, spam, and slurs
    </p>
    <li><strong>Explicit</strong>: Most vulgar language has been retained</li>
    <p class="footnote">Only spam and slurs have been removed/replaced</p>
  </ul>
  <p class="danger">Only download one version at a time!</p>
</div>

<h2>Content/language warning</h2>
<p>
  Despite the automated detected and removal of vulgar terms, there is still a
  chance that I missed some text that should have been removed (especially in
  the explicit version). If you notice any language that shouldn't be in the
  mod, please <a href="#/contact">let me know</a>.
