<h2>How the translations were done</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Strings were extracted from the game using
    <a href="https://sims4toolkit.com/" target="_blank">S4TK</a>, and prepared
    for translation
  </li>
  <p class="footnote">
    Non-translatable strings were filtered out, and steps were taken to make
    sure the translator doesn't mangle tokens
  </p>
  <li>
    String were translated with a locally hosted
    <a href="https://libretranslate.com/" target="_blank">Libre Translate</a>
    server
  </li>
  <p class="footnote">
    Libre Translate is powered by the open source
    <a href="https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate/" target="_blank"
      >Argos Translate library</a
    >
  </p>
  <li>
    Scripts were run on the output to check for irregularities, vulgar language,
    and spam so they could be manually reviewed
  </li>
  <p class="footnote">
    After about 20 rounds of cleaning, no entries were being flagged
  </p>
  <li>
    Prominent strings, like moods and the home menu, were translated even more
    times
  </li>
  <p class="footnote">
    This was just bork them as much as I possibly could, to keep things
    interesting
  </p>
</ul>

<p class="mt-6">
  In the end, it took about 50 hours of computation time to translate and clean
  all of the text. NLP is no small task, folks!
